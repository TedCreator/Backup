<h1> ZipUp - Backup Tool </h1>



A WIP program to backup files <br>
Requires 7zip to be installed (for now) and executable folder added to PATH environmental variable. <br>

Some Plans: <br>
Finish the concept idea which uses the shell interface<br>
Create a version of a command line integrated tool which can be used as a command with flags for script automation. <br>
Create a version with a UI. <br>
Combine these ideas to possibly create a "background" app which will backup files automatically in intervals when used as a continuously running app. <br>

COMPLETED zipping method change to use a minizip library which recursively adds files to archive <br>
COMPLETED migration to JSON data structure <br>
