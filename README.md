# ZipUp - Backup Tool
A WIP program to backup files


Some Plans:
Finish the concept idea which uses shell commands.
Possibly change using shell commands to using a library which can do the same thing as the 7zip command line tool.
Create a version of a command line integrated tool which can be used as a command with flags for script automation.
Create a version with a UI.
Combine these ideas to possibly create a "background" app which will backup files automatically in intervals when used as a continuously running app.
