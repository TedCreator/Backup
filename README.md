# ZipUp - Backup Tool
A WIP program to backup files <br>
Requires 7zip to be installed (for now) and executable folder added to PATH environmental variable. <br>

Some Plans: <br>
Finish the concept idea which uses shell commands. <br>
Possibly change using shell commands to using a library which can do the same thing as the 7zip command line tool. <br>
Create a version of a command line integrated tool which can be used as a command with flags for script automation. <br>
Create a version with a UI. <br>
Combine these ideas to possibly create a "background" app which will backup files automatically in intervals when used as a continuously running app. <br>
